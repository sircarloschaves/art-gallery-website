## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was my first time making a landing page with two pages, so I learned how to structure them.
I also learned how to use the mix-blend-mode property.

### Continued development

I will continue to improve my layouts, and as I improve with Javascript I will start using it in my projects.
